Problem 8
- Write a program that loops many times, each time using an inner loop to access every 4096th element of a large array of bytes. Time how long your program takes per array access. Do this with varying array sizes. Are there any array sizes when the average time suddenly changes? Write a report in which you explain what you did and the hardware and software system context in which you did it, carefully enough that someone could replicate your results.

I wrote a Java program on my Macbook that loops through an array byte by byte and checks if the index is a remainder of 0 when taking modulo 4096. The Java function I used to test the elapsed time was System.nanoTime for the most precise timing (down to the nanosecond). I tested it on an array 100,000 bytes, 500,000 bytes, and 1,000,000 bytes. The 100,000 byte and 500,000 byte array didn't give any consistent values for the elapsed time between accessing array values, ranging from 150 to 350 nanoseconds. The 1,000,000 byte array seemed to converge to a smaller elapsed time between array access after about 500,000 iterations, about 80 nanoseconds.

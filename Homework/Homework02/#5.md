Problem 3
# Two-phase locking
- It is possible for T2 to see the old value of x and the new value of y using two-phase locking.
This is because two-phase locking possesses serializability, which optimizes the system's consistency
when traversing through states. The "old value" of x would be in serial history through two-phase locking,
which allows it to be read along with the new value of y.

# Assuming the real committed isolation level is used
- T2 seeing the old value of x and the new value of y is not guaranteed for assumming that the
real committed isolation level is used. This is because T2 seeing the old value of x would only occurr during
a dirty read/ non-repeatable read, which would let T2 see the memory twice and see two different values.
It is safe to say that this is possible over many attempts, simply because a plethora of values can be
seen through a dirty read, not ensuring the old value of x and the new value of y every time.

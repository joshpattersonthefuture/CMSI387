#### Write a short paragraph explaining why your program is immune to deadlock?
The deadlock situation for the Dining Philosopher problem is that each philosopher reaches for the left fork, therefore, no philosopher is able to reach for a right fork. This infinite circular pattern is where our deadlock resolves. To solve this issue, we made every last philosopher in each cycle reach for the right fork instead. We implemented this in code by writing the if statement:
```
  if (i == philosophers.length - 1) {
                philosophers[i] = new Philosopher(rightFork, leftFork); 
            } else {
                philosophers[i] = new Philosopher(leftFork, rightFork);
            }
```
This allows the last philosopher to pick up the right fork to break the deadlock, and if its not the last philosopher, then continue picking up the left fork.

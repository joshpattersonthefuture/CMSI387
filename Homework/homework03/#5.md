#### In the TopicServer implementation shown in Figures 10.9 and 10.10 on pages 456 and 457, the receive method invokes each subscriber's receive method. This means the TopicServer's receive method will not return to its caller until after all of the subscribers have received the message. Consider an alternative version of the TopicServer, in which the receive method simply places the message into a temporary holding area and hence can quickly return to its caller. Meanwhile, a separate thread running in the TopicServer repeatedly loops, retrieving messages from the holding area and sending each in turn to the subscribers. What Java class from Chapter 4 would be appropriate to use for the holding area? Describe the pattern of synchronization provided by that class in terms that are specific to this particular application.

A bounded buffer will be the optimal java class for this specific holding area. As described in the notes, every time the producer has a new value ready, the producer will store the value into an intermediate storage area, called a buffer. When the consumer is ready, it will retrieve the next value, allowing the processes to work as optimally as possible without carrying on extra time.

Problem 7
- Under figure 6.13, it basically states that the IA-32 two-level page table has a directory that
poitns to 1024 chunks of the page table. Also, each of which can point to 1024 page frames. This means that the directory can act as a variable for the page range(page * n, page * (n+1) ), as seen for page 1023. 1023's range is 1047552-1048575 from the diagram, so we can simply use the directory variable to solve for the rest of the pages, which are 1047552 and 1047553.

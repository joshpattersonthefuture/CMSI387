Problem 3
# Two-phase locking
- It is possible for T2 to see the old value of x and the new value of y using two-phase locking.
this is because two-phase locking possesses serializability, which optimizes the system's consistency
when traversing through states. The "old value" of x would be in serial history through two-phase locking,
which allows it to be read along with the new value of y.

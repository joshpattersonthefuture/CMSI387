#2
This would be a bug because by removing State snapshot= state.get(), this would result in:
state.get() calling getSeatsRemaining() and getCashonHand(), which were originally
meant to be called for the same state. These would now be attached to two different states.
A bug when then occurr when state.get().getSeatsRemaining() and state.get.getCashOnHand()
are called, resulting in the state not being able to update.

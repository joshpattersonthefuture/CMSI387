#### Write a short paragraph explaining why your program is immune to deadlock?
The deadlock situation for the Dining Philosopher problem is that each philosopher reaches for the left fork, therefore, no philosopher is able to reach for a right fork. This infinite circular pattern is where our deadlock resolves. To solve this issue, we made every even numbered philosopher (including 0) in each cycle reach for the right fork first, then the left. Every odd numbered philosopher picked up the left fork first, then the left. This allows no errors or conflictions between which chopstick is picked up by which philosopher. By creating threads for each philosopher and chopstick, we were able to trace their state and implement a pattern which would allow each philosopher an equally random chance to grab both chopsticks to eat.

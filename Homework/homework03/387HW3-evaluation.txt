Comments:
---------
I got seven warning messages when I compiled your DiningPhilosophers.c
program, then when I ran it I got no output.  You wrote a lot of code, so
I'm giving you partial credit.  If you can get it working ASAP and commit
a new version, I'll re-evaluate it.  Using different forks is very helpful,
but you can also consider having them hold the forks for random times.

For #3 there are two difficulties.  First, your file name won't compile on
a UNIX O/S because of the "#" in the name.  I copied it to a new name,
"prob3copy.c" so it would compile.  The second problem is that you didn't
close the STDOUT_FILENO file descriptor and re-open it with the file name
of "/etc/passwd" as was required.  Hence, running the program produces no
output, it just sits there.

There is no code for #4 at all.
